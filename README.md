Flooding is a natural disaster that affects all populated continents and is commonly regarded as the most prevalent, widespread, and destructive disaster to have impacted human communities. While floods have the tendency to cause loss of life and property, they are also part of the natural hydrological cycle with ecological and positive effects on society, especially in regions suffering from extended drought. In fact, frequent flooding is vital in maintaining the ecological balance of riverine and coastal wetland ecosystems. With time, human societies have attempted to better understand, analyze, and forecast flood events and effects. To facilitate this, flood inundation models have been extensively constructed and applied (Teng et al, 2017). Over the past decades, since the 1970s, scientific advancements have been made with large leaps in improving the efficiency of flood inundation models that are now applied extensively to map flood risk (Apel et al., 2006; Dutta et al., 2006), damage (Merz et al., 2010), real-time forecasting of floods (Arduino et al., 2005), floodplain ecology (Karim et al., 2015), hydrology based on climate change scenarios (Ikhwali et al, 2022), and catchment hydrology (Abbott et al., 1986; Beven, 1989).
Despite this, flood modeling in rural, mountainous, or steep-slope terrain is difficult due to the complex terrain and microtopography that govern surface runoff processes (Wang et al, 2025). Steep cropland, and terrace rice fields specifically, plays a crucial role in regulating runoff and mitigating flood risk through its function as distributed retention and conveyance systems (Nohara and Yamada, 2022; Chen et al, 2017). However, accurately modeling hydrological processes in these landscapes requires detailed representation of the topographic features, especially the numerous small channels that regulate flow within the areas.
While traditional flood models rely on simplifying assumptions of channel geometry, which may be derived from empirical relationships of channel width, depth, and contributing area, such assumptions are inadequate for capturing the flow dynamics of steep landscapes. Overgeneralization of channel properties may lead to underestimation of flood peak timing, extent, and localized inundation. Therefore, acquiring precise elevation and channel geometry data is essential to develop physically based flood models for such systems.
Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) and Digital Terrain Models (DTMs) are fundamental datasets for flood modeling. Open-access DEMs such as SRTM, ASTER GDEM, and ALOS PALSAR are easily accessible but have low resolutions that limit their application in complex, steep terrains. High-resolution elevation data from UAV-based LiDAR or ground surveys offer the required accuracy (Kumar et al, 2023), but are typically infeasible due to their exorbitant cost and logistical constraints, particularly over large and inaccessible rural landscapes
Remote sensing-based DTMs (RS-DTMs), derived from satellite data, provide a hopeful way to fill this understanding gap. They have the potential to deliver extensive area coverage and high-resolution terrain modeling with significantly reduced fieldwork input. The effectiveness of RS-DTMs has already been demonstrated in current studies on lowland flood modeling (Rau et al., 2024). Their potential to capture small-scale hydrological details, i.e., narrow irrigation and drainage ditches in sloping cropland, remains almost unexplored territory.
The study aimed to verify the applicability of high-resolution RS-DTMs to flood simulation in steep-slope farmland on the basis of their ability to capture fine-scale channel geometry and hydrologic characteristics. A comparison among RS-DTMs, publicly available LiDAR data from the Geospatial Information Authority of Japan (GSI), and accurate surveyed UAV-based LiDAR data, which serves as a reference, is conducted. By focusing on the representation of channel cross-sectional profiles and their implications for surface runoff simulation, this research seeks to advance the use of satellite-derived terrain data toward more robust and scalable flood modeling in complex mountainous topography
