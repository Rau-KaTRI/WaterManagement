Flooding is a global phenomenon that causes casualties and
property loss on every inhabited continent. It is probably the most
devastating, widespread and frequent natural disaster for human
societies. On the other hand, the impact of flooding is not always
negative as it is a part of a natural cycle and can have great environmental and social benefits, particularly in areas which have
suffered from prolonged drought. Periodic scouring floods are even
crucial for ecosystems in most riverine and coastal wetlands.
Throughout human history, there has been a constant
endeavour to understand, assess and predict flood events and their
impact. Flood inundation models are therefore developed to serve
this purpose. As flooding accounts for a significant proportion of
the total number of reported natural disasters occurring in the
world, and over the last 30 years this proportion has been
increasing (Freer et al., 2011), the development and application of
flood inundation models and relevant research have become a
global endeavour.
Systematic efforts within the research community since the
1970s have greatly improved the capability of flood inundation
modelling. The models are widely used in flood risk mapping (Apel
et al., 2006; Dutta et al., 2006), flood damage assessment (Merz et al., 2010), real-time flood forecasting
(Arduino et al., 2005),floodplain ecology (Karim
et al., 2015), river system hydrology (Dutta et al., 2013) and
catchment hydrology (Abbott et al., 1986; Beven, 1989)
